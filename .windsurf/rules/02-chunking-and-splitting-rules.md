# Chunking and Text Splitting Rules

Last reviewed: 2025-08-11

Use chunking that preserves coherence while fitting model/token budgets.

## Defaults
- **Recursive splitter** with ordered separators (e.g., `\n\n`, `\n`, ` `. then fallback) and overlap to reduce boundary loss.
- **Semantic splitter** only when embeddings are available and budgeted; otherwise stick to recursive.
- **Chunk size/overlap**: Tune per task; start with conservative sizes, validate with recall/precision in retrieval.

## Project Guidance
- Use `createResearchSplitter()` in `src/ai/text-splitter.ts`.
- Avoid external calls in tests; mock `generateTextEmbedding()` when exercising semantic splitting.
- Ensure each chunk carries sufficient context for summarization prompts; consider chunk expansion around headings.

## Anti-Patterns
- Overlapping too much (wastes tokens) or too little (context loss at boundaries).
- Large chunks that exceed downstream prompt budgets when batched.
